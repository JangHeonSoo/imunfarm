You thought you'd buy some solar panels, put them up on the land, and that's it. Reality? It's an ocean of paperwork. The permitting process alone takes at least 6 months — and if things go sideways, 2 years. Cases where a single missing document forces you to restart from scratch are all too common. That's why the order matters. One step at a time, nothing skipped. "More haste, less speed" — in this field, it's just plain fact. <br />

Let's break down each step. <br />

## Step 1. Preliminary Survey & Site Review — Read the Land Before Spreading Paperwork

80% of the outcome is determined here. That's not an exaggeration. <br />

<strong>What to check:</strong> <br />

- Issue a Land Use Plan Confirmation Certificate → Distinguish Agricultural Promotion Zone / Protection Zone / General Farmland <br />
- Check municipal setback distance ordinances (one phone call to the city/county urban planning department) <br />
- Environmental Spatial Information Service (egis.me.go.kr) → Verify ecological grade <br />
- National Heritage Portal (heritage.go.kr) → Check cultural heritage within 500m <br />
- Sunlight analysis (regional sunshine hours available on the Korea Meteorological Administration's data portal) <br />

Add one more: <strong>Site visit</strong>. A map might show flat terrain, but visiting in person might reveal no utility poles, a livestock barn next door, or a drainage channel blocking the pillar placement. Always check with your own two feet. <br />

<strong>Timeline:</strong> 1-2 weeks (up to a month if thorough) <br />

---

## Step 2. KEPCO Grid Access Verification — Skip This First and Everything Falls Apart

If you build a plant but can't sell the electricity, the business doesn't work. <br />

- Check <strong>distribution facility availability</strong> through your KEPCO regional office (or KEPCO website) <br />
- Determine available capacity, waitlist volume, and estimated construction costs upfront <br />
- Solar-dense areas like Jeonnam, Jeonbuk, Jeju, and Gyeongbuk often have <strong>grid saturation</strong> blocking access <br />

If there's no grid capacity, you either abandon the project or find another site. Learning "grid access isn't available" after investing time and money into permits is truly painful. <br />

<strong>Timeline:</strong> Immediately – 1 week <br />

---

## Step 3. Farmland Temporary Use Permit Application — The Core Gateway for Agrivoltaics

Agrivoltaics doesn't 'convert' the farmland. Under <strong>Article 36 of the Farmland Act (Temporary Use for Other Purposes)</strong>, you receive permission to temporarily use the farmland with the condition of restoring it afterward. <br />

![Agri Permit Document](/images/agri-permit-document.png)

<strong>Application authority:</strong> Mayor / County head / District head <br />

<strong>Required documents (key items):</strong> <br />

- Farmland temporary use permit application <br />
- Business plan (including concurrent farming plan) <br />
- Land registration, land register <br />
- Farmland restoration plan <br />
- Land ownership verification (lease agreement if rented) <br />
- Continued farming plan (crop type, cultivation area, projected yield, etc.) <br />

<strong>Permit duration:</strong> Currently <strong>maximum 8 years</strong> (extension to 23 years being pursued, not yet finalized) <br />

<strong>Timeline:</strong> Approximately 1-2 months <br />

One important note: agrivoltaics bypasses urban planning committee review for development activities — a key difference from standard solar. Also, <strong>no farmland conservation fee is charged</strong>. This is a significant cost savings. <br />

---

## Step 4. Power Generation Business License Application — Province or MOTIE?

Under the Electricity Business Act, you need a <strong>generation business license</strong> to produce and sell electricity. <br />

<strong>Licensing authority:</strong> <br />

- <strong>3,000kW (3MW) or less:</strong> Provincial/Metropolitan Governor <br />
- <strong>Over 3,000kW:</strong> Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy <br />
- Some cities/counties can issue their own permits for 500kW-1,500kW <br />
- Jeju: Governor handles even 3MW+ <br />

<strong>Required documents:</strong> <br />

- Electricity business license application (Electricity Business Act Enforcement Rules Form No. 1) <br />
- Business plan (plant overview, generation forecast, financing plan, etc.) <br />
- Land use plan confirmation certificate <br />
- KEPCO technical review confirmation <br />
- Plant layout diagram and wiring diagram <br />

<strong>Notes:</strong> <br />

- Financing plan requires <strong>minimum 10% equity ratio</strong> <br />
- Technical staffing plan must be specific <br />
- Processing time: <strong>approximately 40-60 days</strong> <br />

---

## Step 5. Development Activity Permit — Agrivoltaics Gets a Break Here

Standard solar requires a development activity permit plus urban planning review. But since <strong>agrivoltaics is processed as a farmland temporary use permit</strong>, separate development activity permits are often exempted or simplified. <br />

However, <strong>implementation varies by municipality</strong>. Some areas require a separate development activity permit. Always confirm with the relevant city/county urban planning department. <br />

If a development activity permit is required: <br />

- Submit application to city/county office → processed within 15 days <br />
- Review against urban planning ordinance standards <br />
- Conditional permit → license issued <br />

<strong>Timeline:</strong> 2 weeks – 1 month (may be exempted/simplified for agrivoltaics) <br />

---

## Step 6. Grid Interconnection Application — Contracting with KEPCO

Once you have your generation business license, apply to KEPCO for a <strong>Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)</strong>. <br />

<strong>Required documents:</strong> <br />

- PPA application <br />
- Electricity usage application <br />
- Copy of generation business license <br />
- Plant wiring diagram <br />

Once received, KEPCO <strong>begins engineering design</strong>. After design completion, grid interconnection costs are finalized. Costs vary widely depending on distance, transformer capacity, and line condition. <br />

<strong>Timeline:</strong> <br />

- Basic design and approval: 1-3 months <br />
- If line reinforcement needed: <strong>6+ months</strong> <br />
- If new substation needed: <strong>4-6 years(!)</strong> — this applies to large-scale plants, but it's real <br />

---

## Step 7. Construction Plan Notification + Installation — Finally Breaking Ground

The final administrative step in the permit process. <br />

- <strong>Under 10,000kW (10MW):</strong> <strong>Construction Plan Notification</strong> to local government <br />
- <strong>10,000kW and above:</strong> <strong>Construction Plan Approval</strong> application to MOTIE <br />

Once the construction plan notification is accepted, construction begins. <br />

![Agri Structure Assembly](/images/agri-structure-assembly.png)

<strong>Construction checkpoints:</strong> <br />

- Structure height <strong>3m minimum</strong> (must allow farm machinery passage) <br />
- Panel spacing and shading rate must match the business plan <br />
- Grounding, waterproofing, and wiring must meet electrical equipment standards <br />

<strong>Construction period:</strong> <strong>About 2-4 weeks</strong> for 100kW, 1-2 months for larger systems <br />

---

## Step 8. Pre-Use Inspection — No Green Light from Electrical Safety = No Electricity

Construction completion doesn't mean you can immediately sell power. You must pass the <strong>Korea Electrical Safety Corporation's</strong> pre-use inspection. <br />

- On-site inspection to verify electrical equipment meets safety standards <br />
- Checks grounding resistance, insulation resistance, system protection devices, etc. <br />
- Upon passing: <strong>Pre-Use Inspection Certificate</strong> issued <br />

<strong>Timeline:</strong> Approximately 2-4 weeks after application <br />

---

## Step 9. Facility Confirmation & REC Registration + Business Commencement — The Key That Opens Revenue

After passing the pre-use inspection, you must apply for <strong>facility confirmation</strong> at the Korea Energy Agency's New and Renewable Energy Center <strong>within 1 month</strong>. <br />

Miss this deadline? RECs <strong>will not be issued</strong> for generation prior to that month. That's money you could have earned but didn't. Never miss this. <br />

<strong>Documents required for facility confirmation:</strong> <br />

- Business registration certificate <br />
- Generation business license <br />
- Pre-use inspection certificate <br />
- KEPCO contract number and commercial operation start date confirmation <br />

Simultaneously, file a <strong>business commencement notification</strong> with local government. Takes about 2 weeks. <br />

---

## Step 10. Electricity Sales Begin — You're Finally Selling Power

At this point, money actually starts coming in. <br />

![Agri Grid Connection](/images/agri-grid-connection.png)

<strong>Revenue structure:</strong> <br />

- <strong>SMP (System Marginal Price):</strong> Settled through the power exchange <br />
- <strong>REC (Renewable Energy Certificate):</strong> Spot market trading or long-term fixed-price contracts <br />
- <strong>Crop sales:</strong> Harvest from farming under the panels <br />

SMP + REC are settled monthly, with farming revenue added on top. For a 100kW system, annual generation revenue of approximately 20-26 million KRW is expected. <br />

## 3 Common Pitfalls

There are specific points in the permitting process where people most often stumble. Knowing about them in advance means you can avoid them. <br />

<strong>Pitfall 1. Getting the Order Wrong</strong> <br />
Some people start construction and try to get permits afterward. This creates an <strong>illegal structure</strong> — demolition order plus fines. Always follow the sequence: permit first → construction second. <br />

<strong>Pitfall 2. Missing the REC Application Deadline</strong> <br />
You must apply for facility confirmation <strong>within 1 month</strong> of passing the pre-use inspection. This happens during the chaotic construction wrap-up period — forget it, and you lose the first month's RECs. Prepare the documents before construction is complete. <br />

<strong>Pitfall 3. Checking Grid Access Last</strong> <br />
All permits obtained, construction complete — but KEPCO grid access is denied? It actually happens. That's why we emphasize checking at Step 2. <br />

## What Changes When the Special Act Passes?

The core of the agrivoltaics special act bills in the National Assembly is <strong>one-stop permitting</strong>. <br />

- Business plan approval would <strong>automatically process</strong> the farmland temporary use permit <br />
- Generation business license and development activity permit would be <strong>reviewed together</strong> <br />
- Government would provide <strong>priority purchase and consulting</strong> support for generated electricity <br />

Currently, Steps 3, 4, and 5 must be done separately, but if the special act passes, these could be bundled into a single process. This could cut the timeline nearly in half. <br />

Permitting is tedious, slow, and sometimes frustrating. But going through the process properly means your plant is legally protected and runs stably for 20+ years. Approach each form with the mindset that "the paperwork protects me," and fill them in one by one. <br />
