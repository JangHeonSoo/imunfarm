Solar panels on top of a rice paddy. Rice growing underneath. Sounds like a dream — but in 2026, it's becoming reality. <br />
Agrivoltaics is a system that combines farming and power generation simultaneously. <br />
Field trials have shown revenue up to 8.4 times higher than rice farming alone. <br />
But when you actually try to get started? There's a lot more to check than you'd think. <br />
There are cases where people lost tens of millions of won by diving in unprepared. <br />
"Locking the barn door after the horse has bolted" — that saying is especially apt in this field.

## 1. Farmland Act Amendments and Special Legislation: Where Do Things Stand?

The very first thing to check is the law. You can have the money, the land, and the will — but if the law doesn't allow it, you can't proceed.

The current Farmland Act limits the temporary use period for agrivoltaics to a <strong>maximum of 8 years</strong>. <br />
Solar panels last 20-25 years, but you're told to dismantle after 8 — making investment recovery impossible. <br />
According to the Korea Rural Economic Institute, a <strong>minimum of 20 years</strong> is needed to generate meaningful returns.

On October 16, 2025, the government signaled major changes at the 2nd Core Regulation Rationalization Strategy Meeting:

- Extending farmland use period from <strong>8 → 23 years</strong>
- Allowing generation businesses in <strong>Agricultural Promotion Areas</strong> when designated as 'Renewable Energy Zones'
- Permitting <strong>village cooperative corporations</strong> as business operators
- <strong>Legislating setback distances</strong> (Renewable Energy Act amendment)

However, as of February 2026, the Ministry of Agriculture officially stated that "the requirements for agrivoltaics businesses have <strong>not been finalized</strong>." <br />
This means deliberations are ongoing with the National Assembly and agriculture sector on the Agrivoltaics Special Act. <br />
At least <strong>4 related bills</strong> have already been introduced in the National Assembly.

<strong>Key takeaway:</strong> The law hasn't been finalized yet. <br />
The target is Farmland Act amendment in the first half of 2026, but it could be delayed by the Assembly's schedule. <br />
Rather than rushing to install, closely monitor when the legislation passes.

## 2. Setback Distances — The 'Invisible Wall' That Varies by Municipality

How far must solar equipment be placed from homes and roads? <br />
This setback distance regulation is one of the biggest obstacles for agrivoltaics.

The problem is that <strong>standards differ by municipality</strong>. <br />
Some require as little as <strong>300m</strong>, others up to <strong>1km</strong>. <br />
Even within the same province, neighboring counties can have different standards. <br />
In some areas, finding "eligible land" is like finding a needle in a haystack.

The government plans to amend the Renewable Energy Act to create <strong>nationally unified standards</strong> for setback distances. <br />
But the amendment hasn't been finalized yet. <br />
If you're pushing ahead now, you <strong>must directly verify your local municipality's ordinances</strong>. <br />
Don't rely on internet information — one phone call to your city/county's renewable energy department is the most accurate approach.

Experts consistently advocate for setback distance exemptions for agrivoltaics, so keep an eye on the legislative direction as well.

## 3. Yield Reduction — "20% Is Fine" Is Only Half True

Growing crops under agrivoltaics panels reduces sunlight by <strong>about 30%</strong>. <br />
This leads to yield reduction. <br />
The commonly cited figure is an <strong>average 15-20% reduction</strong>.

But don't be fooled by the average.

![Crop growth under Agrivoltaics](/images/agrivoltaics-crop-growth.png)

According to data submitted to the National Assembly's Agriculture Committee in 2025, rice yield reductions of up to <strong>71%</strong> were confirmed. <br />
This came from a pilot installation by Korea South-East Power in Geochang-gun, Gyeongnam. <br />
The "average 15.7%" figure masked these extreme cases.

Conversely, crops like green tea, figs, and grapes actually <strong>showed improved yields</strong>. <br />
Solar panels protect against extreme heat and reduce damage from typhoons and cold snaps. <br />
A comprehensive survey of 66 pilot sites nationwide over 6 years (2016-2021) found that most crops maintained at least 80% productivity.

<strong>So what should you do?</strong>

- Yield reduction varies <strong>completely depending on crop type</strong>
- Shade-tolerant crops (wasabi, mushrooms, myoga) actually benefit
- Rice shows high variance by region and equipment — <strong>always check data from nearby pilot sites</strong>
- Regulations similar to Japan's (revoking permits when yields drop below 80%) are likely coming

Crop selection isn't just a farming decision — it's a business survival decision.

## 4. Installation Costs and Profitability — Run the Numbers

Use calculation, not intuition.

<strong>100kW installation cost:</strong> approximately <strong>150-200 million KRW</strong>. <br />
That's about <strong>1.3-1.5x more expensive</strong> than standard ground-mount solar. <br />
Structures must be raised above 3m for farm machinery access, and wider module spacing requires about 1.5x more area.

<strong>Revenue structure (H2 2025):</strong>

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| SMP (System Marginal Price) | ~111-114 KRW/kWh |
| REC (Renewable Energy Certificate) | ~71,000-72,000 KRW/REC |
| REC weighting (agrivoltaics) | 0.7 (same as standard solar) |
| Annual revenue (100kW) | ~20-26.6 million KRW |

In a pilot case in Yeongam-gun, Jeonnam, a 45kW system on 1,000㎡ (about 300 pyeong) combining rice farming and generation produced <strong>total revenue of 9.89 million KRW</strong> in one year. <br />
That's <strong>8.4x higher</strong> than rice farming alone (~1.18 million KRW). <br />
However, <strong>equipment and installation costs are not included</strong> in this figure. <br />
A Yeongam-gun official analyzed that "meaningful income changes appear only <strong>after 7 years</strong>."

The industry consensus is that investment recovery takes <strong>at least 12 years</strong>. <br />
At 8 years, losses are nearly guaranteed. Only at 23 years do you enter profit territory. <br />
These numbers make clear why the legal amendment matters.

Subsidies and long-term low-interest loans can significantly reduce the initial burden. <br />
Group purchasing at the village level can cut per-kW installation costs by <strong>5-12%</strong>.

## 5. Grid Connection (KEPCO Access) — You Can Build a Plant and Still Not Sell Electricity

This is where many people get caught. Installing solar panels isn't the end. <br />
You must be <strong>connected to KEPCO's grid</strong> to sell electricity.

The problem is <strong>grid saturation</strong>. Areas with concentrated solar like Jeonnam, Jeonbuk, Jeju, and Gyeongbuk have already hit transmission capacity limits. <br />
As of 2025, <strong>437MW of capacity</strong> was waiting for grid access. <br />
In Jeonnam, more than 1 in 2 small-scale solar plants experienced grid connection delays.

The Ministry of Trade is working to clear the backlog, but building new substations takes <strong>3-6 years</strong> depending on location. <br />
Even with government access guarantee policies, "waiting 2-3 years after applying is standard" is a common complaint.

<strong>Must-do before installation:</strong>

- Contact your KEPCO regional office to <strong>verify access availability</strong>
- Check if there's a large backlog in your area
- Include <strong>opportunity costs</strong> (interest, maintenance) from access delays in your calculations

Building a plant and not being able to sell electricity — that's truly agonizing.

## 6. Post-Installation Management and Dismantling — The End Is Just Another Beginning

Agrivoltaics can be more complex to <strong>operate and dismantle</strong> than to install.

Under current guidelines, dismantling is <strong>the farmer's responsibility and judgment call</strong>. <br />
Soil contamination testing is done only about once a year. <br />
There are <strong>no government-level post-management standards or guarantee system plans yet</strong>. <br />
This means dismantling costs could fall entirely on the farmer.

Japan's experience shows how serious this issue can become. <br />
Japan has over <strong>5,000 agrivoltaics facilities</strong> in operation, but many cases emerged where farming was neglected in favor of generation revenue. <br />
Japan's government now mandates <strong>dismantling orders</strong> when yields fall below <strong>80%</strong> of the previous year.

Korea is likely heading in a similar direction. <br />
The President has directly stated that "provisions could impose <strong>fines larger than generation revenue</strong> when farming is not maintained."

<strong>Checklist:</strong>

- Get advance estimates for <strong>dismantling costs</strong> 20 years from now
- Develop an <strong>environmental monitoring</strong> plan for soil contamination
- Keep meticulous <strong>yield records</strong> annually (for re-permitting and audits)
- Continuously monitor as post-management regulations may change frequently

## 7. Tenant Farmer Protection and Village Conflicts — People Problems Are the Hardest

Technology and money can be solved. But conflicts between people are different.

A significant portion of Korean farmers are <strong>tenant farmers</strong> — people farming on rented land. <br />
As agrivoltaics expands, <strong>farmland rents go up</strong>. <br />
Generation revenue drives up land values, which drives up rents. The burden falls entirely on tenants.

![Community Engagement](/images/agrivoltaics-community-meeting.png)

Recognizing this issue, Democratic Party lawmaker Lim Mi-ae introduced legislation to "allow generation facilities only on self-owned farmland." <br />
The government has also pledged to provide tenant farmers with opportunities to participate in generation businesses and share revenue.

At the village level, conflict factors are significant:

- Complaints that "solar installations next to my field <strong>will ruin the landscape</strong>"
- Resentment over <strong>revenue concentrating among specific farms</strong>
- <strong>Food security concerns</strong> over Agricultural Promotion Area deregulation

The government's three principles — <strong>preventing sprawl, food security, and community benefit sharing</strong> — if not upheld, even well-intentioned policy can divide a village. <br />
Village cooperative corporations where all residents participate and share revenue represent the healthiest model.

Before installing, have honest conversations with neighboring farmers. This should come before any technical review.

## A Final Word

Agrivoltaics can genuinely be a game-changer for rural areas. <br />
8x rice farming revenue. Carbon neutrality. Energy independence. All sitting on a single panel.

But right now, we're in a <strong>transitional period</strong>. Laws are being written, standards are being set. <br />
Rushing in blindly during this period is risky. <br />
Conversely, if you sit idle and only move after laws are finalized, the best locations may already be taken.

The first-half 2026 Farmland Act amendment vote will be the decisive inflection point. <br />
For now: <strong>prepare, but don't rush</strong>. <br />
Survey your land, crunch the numbers, meet with people, and watch the legislation.
