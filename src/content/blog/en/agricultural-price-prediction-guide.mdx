Last year when onion prices nosedived, every group chat was saying the same thing.<br/>
"Planted based on last year's prices, and look where that got us."<br/>
The same old line.

Truth is, agricultural price prediction is already happening everywhere.<br/>

<strong>KAMIS</strong>, public wholesale markets, local governments, even private apps.
<br />
But when it comes to my own field, my own greenhouse — information that directly answers "what to plant, how much, and when to sell" — that's hard to find.

Instead of showing off fancy AI models,<br/>

this article breaks down how to scrape <strong>KAMIS</strong> and wholesale market data to make practical "<strong>crop selection</strong>" and "<strong>shipping timing</strong>" decisions,
<br />
focused on real actions you can take.

---

## 1. Looking at "Patterns," Not "Averages" with KAMIS Data

Let's start with the <strong>KAMIS</strong> site.<br/>
Here are the URLs.

- <strong>KAMIS</strong> main: https://www.kamis.or.kr/customer/main/main.do
  <br />
- Daily wholesale prices: https://www.kamis.or.kr/customer/price/bizcondition/catalogue.do?action=daily<br/>
- Quick price info (consumer prices/simple lookup): https://www.kamis.or.kr/customer/info/retail/period.do?action=daily

The basic structure of <strong>KAMIS</strong> data looks like this.
<br />
- Product category/subcategory codes (e.g., vegetables, onion, dried onion, etc.)
<br />
- Wholesale/retail classification
<br />
- Survey date
<br />
- Prices by quality grade (high/medium/low) or average price
<br />- Survey region (wholesale market or consumer price reference area)

Here's a common mistake.<br/>
"Last year's average price was such-and-such." And that's where it ends.<br/>
Averages alone won't help you pick the right crop or time your shipments.

### 1-1. Look at These 3 Things at Minimum

Pick a specific product (e.g., onions, garlic, cabbage) on <strong>KAMIS</strong>,
<br />
and download the last 3-5 years' data to Excel.

At minimum, check these:

1. Annual average wholesale price<br/>
2. Monthly average wholesale price<br/>
3. Annual/monthly peak and trough ranges

For onions, for example:<br/>

- Do prices drop when shipments pile up from May to July?<br/>
- How do prices spike when storage onions come out (winter to early spring)?<br/>
- Were there abnormal crashes or surges in specific years only?

Only then can you tell whether "last year was a special case" or "that's the normal pattern."

### 1-2. Avoiding "Price Valleys" with Moving Averages

No need to overcomplicate things in Excel.<br/>

- Sort daily price data chronologically<br/>
- Run 7-day, 14-day, and 30-day <strong>moving averages</strong>.

With <strong>moving averages</strong>,
<br />
- Days when supply got disrupted by sudden rain<br />
- One-off spikes/drops from volume flooding a specific market
<br />
— this kind of noise gets cleaned up.

Looking at the <strong>moving average</strong> curve,
<br />
"Ah, this product bottoms out around the second week of June every year."
<br />
"It starts creeping up from the last week of October."
<br />
— these patterns become visible.

Just doing this much<br/>
will help you largely avoid "mindlessly planting based on last year's prices."

## 2. Wholesale Market Auction Data: Real On-the-Ground Prices

<strong>KAMIS</strong> is refined information, and slightly delayed.
<br />
Real on-the-ground data comes from public wholesale market auction records.

![Wholesale Market Data Analysis](/images/wholesale-market-data-analysis.png)

These datasets are available on the public data portal:

- National Agricultural, Marine & Livestock Wholesale Market Auction Price Standard Data<br/>
  - https://www.data.go.kr/data/15029181/standard.do<br/>
- National Public Wholesale Market Real-time Auction Info OpenAPI<br/>
  - https://www.data.go.kr/data/15141808/openapi.do<br/>
  - Ministry of Agriculture Public Data Portal "Wholesale Market Real-time Auction Info"

This data contains fields like:<br/>

- Transaction date<br/>
- Wholesale market code/name (Garak, Busan, Daegu, Gwangju, etc.)<br/>
- Product code, variety code<br/>
- Grade<br/>
- Transaction weight (kg)<br/>
- Highest, lowest, and average prices, number of transactions

In a word, it tells you "how much actually traded at Garak Market today, and how many tons."

Even without programming, there are options.<br/>

- Download the standard data as CSV from the public data portal<br/>
- Organize it monthly or quarterly and view it side by side with <strong>KAMIS</strong> data.

## 3. Patterns Already Validated in Research and Field Trials

"Price prediction" has already been tested in multiple places.<br/>
Among them, products like onions and garlic have quite a bit of research.

### 3-1. Onion Wholesale Price Prediction Paper Summary

Among papers from the Korea Information Processing Society ACK 2024:<br/>

- Title: Comparative Analysis of 12 Models' Performance and Regional Results for Onion Wholesale Price Prediction<br/>
- Data used: <strong>KAMIS</strong> daily onion wholesale prices + weather data, etc.<br/>
- Models compared: Linear regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, etc. — 12 total

Key takeaways:<br/>

- Even simple models (linear regression, <strong>moving averages</strong>) are "plenty useful for avoiding disasters."<br/>
- Regional supply-demand structures differ, so even the same model shows large performance gaps across regions.<br/>
- Overly complex deep learning models actually become unstable when data volume is insufficient.

The bottom line: starting with simple models tailored to "our area, our crop" is better.

### 3-2. Government and Public AI Prediction Services

Looking at the Ministry of Agriculture's public data use cases,<br/>

AI-based price prediction services combining <strong>KAMIS</strong>, public wholesale market, and weather data are being developed.

- Agricultural price prediction web/mobile services: <strong>KAMIS</strong> + KOSIS + weather data integration<br/>
- 1-week to 1-month predictions for specific products (onions, garlic, cabbage, etc.)

Also, some municipalities like Gyeongsangnam-do<br/>
have run pilot projects "using AI and big data to predict garlic and onion prices,"<br/>
sending farmers price forecasts via text or app alerts.

Common features of these services:<br/>

- They combine <strong>KAMIS</strong> long-term time series + wholesale auction data + weather/cultivation area data to build models
  <br />
- They deliver simple messages to farmers like "this month's onion prices are expected to be 20% below the normal year."

What we as individual farmers should do<br/>
is reference "what data combinations these services use for prediction"<br/>
and replicate similar combinations in our own spreadsheets or simple code.

## 4. How to Actually Use It: Crop and Shipping Timing Decisions

Now for the most important part.<br/>
Not "browsing" data but using it for "decisions."

### 4-1. Crop Selection: "Should I Plant More Onions This Year or Not?"

Let's use a hypothetical example.<br/>

- My field: 2,000 pyeong<br/>
- Candidate crops: Onions vs. Garlic<br/>
- Dilemma: "Should I expand onions this year, or garlic?"

Steps:

1. Download monthly wholesale price data for onions and garlic for the last 5 years from <strong>KAMIS</strong>.
   <br />
2. Organize annual averages, monthly averages, and peak/trough prices.<br/>
3. Extract garlic and onion auction average prices from Garak Market data.<br/>
4. Conservatively estimate expected yields (kg/pyeong) for your field.<br/>
5. Run a simple prediction model, or at minimum, calculate "normal year range" and "worst-case scenario" separately.

For example:<br/>

- Onion normal year wholesale price: 800 KRW/kg<br/>
- Worst year wholesale price: 400 KRW/kg<br/>
- My yield: 2,000 pyeong × 400 kg/pyeong = 800,000 kg (example — actual yields vary greatly by variety and method)<br/>
- Average scenario revenue: 800,000 kg × 800 KRW = 640 million KRW<br/>
- Worst scenario revenue: 800,000 kg × 400 KRW = 320 million KRW

Calculate garlic the same way:<br/>

- Average scenario revenue<br/>
- Worst scenario revenue<br/>
- Compare the money remaining after subtracting production costs (seeds, supplies, labor, storage).

The key point here is<br/>
"Don't judge by averages alone — look at whether you can survive the worst 1-2 years out of X."

Using data means asking these questions:<br/>

- "Are onion prices already in a low zone relative to historical norms?"<br/>
- "Is garlic actually in the danger zone right now?"

### 4-2. Shipping Timing: "Move Up 3 Days or Delay 1 Week?"

Shipping timing requires more precision.<br/>
Wholesale market auction data really shines here.

1. Pull Garak Market onion auction average prices by date for February-April over the last 5 years.<br/>
2. Mark the "local peak periods" and "trough periods" for each year.<br/>
3. Calculate 7-day and 14-day <strong>moving averages</strong> to see gradual rise/fall zones.

This might reveal patterns like:<br/>

- Many years show prices rising in the 2 weeks before Lunar New Year.<br/>
- After mid-March, volume increases and prices gradually decline.

Then actual decision-making shifts to:<br/>

- "This year storage quality is decent, and the market seems to be following the normal year pattern."<br/>
- "Let's start shipping 10 days before the holiday and aim for peak 3-4 days before."

Conversely:<br/>

- If production-area volume is already flooding the market,<br/>
- And the auction average is tracking below the normal year curve,<br/>
  you can shift your judgment toward "stop being greedy and sell quickly."

This doesn't require advanced AI.<br/>
Just plotting "normal year curve vs. this year's curve" side by side is enough.

## 5. How Complex a Model Do You Really Need?

Now a bit on AI.<br/>
Looking at papers and actual services, we can roughly divide it into three tiers.

Tier 1: Statistics/Excel level<br/>

- <strong>Moving averages</strong>, seasonality (monthly/quarterly pattern) analysis
  <br />
- Average, worst, best scenario simulations<br/>
- For <strong>crop selection</strong>/shipping timing decisions, this level is quite useful.

Tier 2: Simple regression/tree models<br/>

- Input: <strong>KAMIS</strong> prices, wholesale auction prices, weather data, cultivation area, etc.<br/>
- Output: 7-day, 30-day price predictions<br/>
- Advantage: Explanatory power — you can roughly see which factors influence prices.

Tier 3: Deep learning/time-series specialized models (LSTM, Transformer, etc.)<br/>

- Advantage: Can capture more complex patterns.<br/>
- Disadvantage: Becomes unstable without sufficient data, and burdensome for farms to operate directly.

Even in the onion wholesale price prediction paper,<br/>
results showed "making the model more complex doesn't automatically make it better."<br/>
And most government/public services operate at "not too complex" levels.

So for individual farms or small teams, think of it this way:<br/>

- Nail down Tier 1 solidly<br/>
- If needed, apply Tier 2 to gauge "how much prices might deviate from normal."

## 6. Data Limitations and Pitfalls

Not all data should be trusted blindly.<br/>

<strong>KAMIS</strong> and wholesale market data have several limitations.

### 6-1. KAMIS's Structural Limitations

- Survey frequency and standards: Consumer prices are sampled from selected supermarkets and traditional markets.<br/>
- Holidays and weekends can create survey gaps or outliers.<br/>
- Product/grade categories may not perfectly match reality.

Also, <strong>KAMIS</strong> includes processed food retail price information.<br/>

- Example: Prices of processed foods like ramen, cooking oil<br/>
  This is more useful for understanding "consumer-perceived price levels" than for direct crop selection.

### 6-2. Wholesale Market Data Limitations

- Specific market bias: Looking only at Garak Market can distort regional supply-demand pictures.<br/>
- Products/varieties with low trading volumes can show exaggerated price volatility.<br/>
- Real-time auction info APIs can go down or experience delays.

So in practice, you need this checklist:

1. Look at minimum 3 years, preferably 5+ years of data.<br/>
2. View at least 2 types of data together: <strong>KAMIS</strong> + wholesale market.
   <br />
3. For years that deviate significantly from normal patterns, check the news to understand why.<br/>
4. Even if your model says "prices will boom this year," separately calculate production costs and worst-case scenarios.

This much alone can largely avoid the "blind data trust" pitfall.

## 7. A Realistic Usage Scenario for an Individual Farm

![Farmer Data Decision Making](/images/farmer-data-decision-making.png)

Finally, imagine using this as an individual farmer.<br/>
This is for a typical small-scale field farming operation.

1. Download monthly wholesale prices for 4 products — onion, garlic, cabbage, green onion — from <strong>KAMIS</strong> for the last 5 years.
   <br />
2. From public wholesale market auction data, organize annual/monthly average auction prices for 2 markets (Garak and Busan).<br/>
3. Record your local wholesale market's actual prices (NongHyup, nearby intermediary trader prices) for at least 1 year.<br/>
4. In Excel, create:<br/>
   - <strong>Moving averages</strong> (7-day, 30-day)
     <br />
   - Monthly seasonal patterns<br/>
   - Normal year vs. this year curve comparisons<br/>
5. For crop selection:<br/>
   - Calculate average scenario vs. worst scenario net profit,<br/>
   - First check "can I survive the loss in a worst year?"<br/>
6. For shipping timing:<br/>
   - Mark peak/trough zones from normal-year patterns<br/>
   - Update this year's auction curve weekly, just checking "where is today relative to the normal year?"

This much, without any fancy AI,<br/>
gets you a move or two ahead of "planting the same as last year based on last year's prices."

Data is ultimately a tool.<br/>
You can build a house with just a hammer.<br/>
But sketching out where and how to drive the nails beforehand — that's what data is for.
