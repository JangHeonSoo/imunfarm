## The Core of Solar Business — Panel Selection Determines Profitability

When preparing an agrivoltaics business, the very first question you hit is "which panels should I install?" The market has dozens of solar panel types — monocrystalline, polycrystalline, PERC, TOPCon, HJT, bifacial — and specs and warranty terms vary wildly by manufacturer.

For agrivoltaics especially, panel selection is even more critical than conventional solar. You need to maximize power generation while maintaining a shading rate under 30%, ensure stable operation for 25+ years, and secure returns relative to initial investment.

This post provides a detailed analysis of solar panels currently available as of January 2026, based on authoritative government data, official manufacturer specifications, and research institute field trial data, along with recommendations for panels best suited for agrivoltaics and farmland solar.

## Basic Solar Panel Classification

Solar panels are broadly classified by the following criteria.

Monocrystalline panels are solar cells made from a single pure silicon crystal. Characterized by a uniform black appearance and octagonal cell shape, they boast the highest efficiency among solar panels.

**Key Specifications**

| Category | Details |
|------|------|
| Appearance | Uniform black, octagonal cell structure |
| Efficiency | 20%+, max 23.4% |
| Lifespan | 25–30 years |
| Annual efficiency decline | 0.3–0.9% |
| Efficiency after 25 years | ~80–86% retained |

**Advantages**
1) High conversion efficiency enables significant power production even in limited space
2) Excellent performance in low-light conditions
3) Long lifespan with stable performance retention
4) Relatively stable in high-temperature environments

**Disadvantages**
