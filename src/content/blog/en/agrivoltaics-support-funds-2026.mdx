Agrivoltaic installation fee is 170 million KRW. But the government gives 30 million, and local municipalities give 10 million. Actual burden drops drastically to 130 million KRW. The 2026 subsidy budget has expanded. REC multiplier holds firm. But watch out for first-come, first-served limits and strict qualifications. Miss it and you'll regret it. Let's dissect the actual money you can get for 100kW.

Here are all the subsidies explained earlier in one glance. 100kW agrivoltaic basis. Includes minimum actual burden calculation. Clear as day when looking at the table.

## 1. Total Subsidy Scale — 40-60 Million KRW Possible for 100kW

Put <strong>National + Local + Financial Support</strong> together and shrink installation costs by 25-35%.

- <strong>Convergence Support (National)</strong>: Up to 35 million KRW
- <strong>Rural Solar Grant</strong>: Around 20 million KRW
- <strong>Local Municipal Grant</strong>: 5-15 million KRW (varies by region)
- <strong>Financial Aid (Low-interest loan)</strong>: 2% range, 5-year grace, 10-year repayment
- <strong>REC Multiplier Benefit</strong>: Extra 10 million KRW/year revenue

<strong>Actual Receipt Examples</strong>:
- Nonsan City (100kW): Convergence 30M + Local 10M = 40 million KRW. Actual burden 130M KRW.
- Gochang County: Rural Solar 20M + Convergence 25M = 45 million KRW.

## 2. Convergence Support Project — #1 Grant for Agrivoltaics (30-35 Million KRW)

Hosted by Korea Energy Agency. Covers <strong>up to 50% of total project cost</strong> (70% for exterior walls). 2026 budget massively expanded.

<strong>Eligibility</strong>:
- Farmers adding solar + crops on their own land (under 500kW).
- Active cultivators (registered resident >1 year, >1.2M KRW annual revenue).
- Village cooperatives take priority.

<strong>2026 Unit Price (100kW basis, excl. VAT)</strong>:
- Solar facility: 350,000 KRW/kW support → 35 million KRW.
- Total including monitoring: <strong>30-35 million KRW</strong>.

<strong>Application Window</strong>: February - May announcements. First-come, first-served. Select contractor, then apply via BPM (electronic civil service).

<strong>Actual Example</strong>: 2025 Yeongam farm, received 32M KRW in convergence funding for 100kW. Installation dropped from 170M → 138M.

## 3. Rural Solar Support Project — Farmer Exclusive (Around 20 Million KRW)

Ministry of Agriculture + Energy Agency. <strong>Farmer verification support</strong>.

<strong>Target</strong>:
- Livestock barns, agrivoltaic farmland.
- Installed within 5km of residence.
- Cooperatives up to 1.5MW.

<strong>Support Amount</strong>: 200,000 - 300,000 KRW per kW. For 100kW, that's 20-30 million KRW.
- 2026 Expansion: Up to 1,000kW for RE100 companies/factories.

<strong>Application</strong>: Energy Agency website, early year announcements.

## 4. Local Grants — Regional Jackpot (5-20 Million KRW)

Can overlap with national funds. Rural-focused.

<strong>Generous Permit Region Examples</strong>:
- <strong>Gochang/Imsil (Jeonbuk)</strong>: 10 million KRW (added on top of rural solar).
- <strong>Nonsan/Gyeryong (Chungnam)</strong>: 8 million KRW.
- <strong>Yeoncheon (Gyeonggi)</strong>: 5 million KRW (northern development promo).

<strong>Application</strong>: City/County renewable energy department. Apply additionally after convergence selection.

<strong>Total Example</strong>: Convergence 30M + Local 10M = 40 million KRW.

## 5. Financial Aid — Business Without Cash (Low-interest loan)

<strong>Renewable Energy Financial Support</strong>: 2.0-2.5% per year, 5-year grace, 15-year repayment.

- <strong>Loan limit</strong>: Around 1 billion KRW.
- <strong>Guarantee</strong>: KIBO 90% guarantee.
- <strong>100kW Example</strong>: Fully finance 170M KRW. Monthly repayment 1.5M KRW (after grace).

<strong>2026 Change</strong>: RE100/Industrial complex expanded to 1,000kW, factories added.

## 6. REC Multiplier Benefits — Extra 10M KRW Annual Profit

Agrivoltaic multiplier holds at <strong>1.5x</strong>. 100kW generates 130,000 kWh annually.

- Normal REC: 72,000 KRW/MWh × 130 = 9.36 million KRW.
- Agrivoltaic: 1.5x = <strong>14.04 million KRW</strong>.

<strong>Total Annual Revenue</strong>: SMP 15M + REC 14M + Farming 3M = 32 million KRW.

## 7. Qualifications & Application Tips — Don't Miss Out

<strong>Qualifications</strong>:
- Active farmer (agricultural management registration).
- Residency >1 year, revenue proof.
- Select a participating contractor (Energy Agency website list).

<strong>Application Steps</strong>:
1. Check Energy Agency website announcements (Feb-Mar).
2. Choose contractor → Get quota.
3. BPM electronic application (upload documents).
4. Pass screening → Install → Final inspection → Receive funds.

<strong>Period</strong>: Within 1 month of announcement. First-come, first-served.

<strong>Note</strong>: Convergence + Rural Solar cannot overlap. Aim for convergence first to max out.

## 8. Three Actual 100kW Case Studies

<strong>Case 1: Jeonnam Farm (2025)</strong>
- Convergence 32M + Local 8M = 40 million KRW.
- Install 170M → Actual burden 130M. Recovery in 5.5 years.

<strong>Case 2: Chungbuk Livestock Farmer</strong>
- Rural Solar 25M + Full loan.
- Almost zero cash burden.

<strong>Case 3: Northern Gyeonggi</strong>
- Convergence 28M + Yeoncheon County 5M = 33 million KRW.

## 9. Actual Burden Calculation Example

<strong>Base Installation Cost</strong>: 170 million KRW (from earlier text).

| Scenario | Convergence | Rural Solar | Local | Total Support | <strong>Actual Burden</strong> | ROI (32M KRW/yr Rev) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <strong>Minimum</strong> | 30M | - | 5M | 35M | <strong>135 Million</strong> | 4.8 Years |
| <strong>Maximum</strong> | 35M | 20M | 15M | <strong>70M</strong> | <strong>100 Million</strong> | 3.6 Years |
| <strong>Average</strong> | 32M | - | 10M | <strong>42M</strong> | <strong>128 Million</strong> | 4.3 Years |

<strong>Annual Revenue with 1.5x REC</strong>: SMP 15M + REC 14M + Farming 3M = <strong>32 Million KRW</strong>. Maxing subsidies cuts ROI to under 4 years.

## 10. Application Priorities & Tips (Summary)

1. <strong>1st Priority: Convergence</strong> — Biggest and surest. Wait for Feb announcement, apply via BPM.
2. <strong>2nd Priority: Local</strong> — Add on after convergence.
3. <strong>3rd Priority: Rural Solar</strong> — If convergence fails.
4. <strong>REC</strong>: Year-round but needs farming proof (harvest records).

<strong>Core Qualification</strong>: Active farming proof (agricultural management registration, >1.2M KRW revenue, >1 year residency).

2026 agrivoltaics support is a bumper crop. Grab 40-60M KRW and drop your burden by 30%. Don't miss the announcements. Build your 2026 subsidy strategy with this single table. It's first-come, so hurry up.
