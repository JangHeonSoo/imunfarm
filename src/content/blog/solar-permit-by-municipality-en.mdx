Same business plan, same type of land. But City A approves in 2 months while County B puts you on hold for over a year. Why? Because every municipality has different ordinances. The law is the same, but the ground reality is wildly different. One complaint, one line in a local ordinance can make or break your project. Know the characteristics of high-approval regions, and you can target them from the start.

## 1. Setback Distance Ordinances — The #1 Variable

The biggest factor in municipal permit differences is <strong>setback distance regulations</strong>.

Out of 226 basic municipalities nationwide, <strong>139 (61%)</strong> have setback distance ordinances for solar installations. 100m from residential areas, 200m from roads. But these numbers vary wildly between municipalities.

![Distance Measurement in Solar Field](/images/separation-distance-field.png)

- <strong>Easy-approval regions</strong>: No setback requirements, or following government recommendations (100m from residential, 0m from roads)
  - 5 municipalities including Dongducheon and Yeoncheon in Gyeonggi province relaxed to government-recommended levels as of 2024
  - Rural-focused areas like Imsil and Gochang in Jeonbuk have no ordinances or very loose ones

- <strong>Difficult regions</strong>: Setback distances exceeding 1km
  - Uljin and Cheongsong in Gyeongbuk (1km from residential AND roads)
  - Gurye, Wando, and Jangheung in Jeonnam (1km+ from roads)
  - Some western Gyeongnam municipalities (Jinju is strict, Hamyang recently relaxed)

The legal basis for setback ordinances is <strong>Article 58 of the National Land Planning Act</strong>. Municipalities can set these through urban planning ordinances. The government issued recommendations in 2023, but <strong>only 15 municipalities complied</strong>. The rest stick to their own rules.

## 2. Five Common Traits of High-Approval Regions

Data reveals clear patterns. Municipalities that approve easily share these characteristics.

<strong>Trait 1: Relaxed or Abolished Setback Ordinances</strong>

- Following government recommendations: Only 5 municipalities including Dongducheon and Yeoncheon in Gyeonggi
- No ordinances at all: Rural areas like Imsil, Gochang, Sunchang in Jeonbuk
- Recently relaxed: Hamyang (western Gyeongnam), some Chungbuk areas

<strong>Trait 2: Available Grid Capacity</strong>

Solar-dense regions (Jeonnam, Jeonbuk, Jeju) resist permits due to grid saturation. Conversely:

- Northern Gyeonggi (Yeoncheon, Pocheon, Dongducheon): High grid availability, strong demand near Seoul
- Parts of Chungcheong (Goesan, Boeun in Chungbuk): Lots of farmland, few power plants
- Gangwon mountain areas: Low landscape concerns, farming-focused

<strong>Trait 3: Strong Mayoral/County Head Support</strong>

The municipal leader's attitude toward solar is decisive.

- <strong>Positive leadership</strong>: Mayors who campaigned on "increasing farm income through solar"
- <strong>Negative regions</strong>: Those emphasizing "preventing reckless development"

After the 2025 local elections, officials facing re-election are leaning toward deregulation. Political orientation directly affects approval rates.

<strong>Trait 4: Active Demonstration Sites and Support Programs</strong>

Municipalities that hosted government demonstration projects have lower barriers.

- Yeongam in Jeonnam: Successful agrivoltaics demonstration → follow-up projects approved easily
- Eumseong in Chungbuk: Active rural solar support program participation
- Yangju in Gyeonggi: Leading RE100 village projects

<strong>Trait 5: High Community Acceptance in True Rural Areas</strong>

Not suburban areas — genuinely rural communities.

- Declining mountain villages: "Youth inflow + income generation" welcomed
- Areas with active village cooperatives: Preference for community-participatory projects
- Pure agricultural areas (not tourist spots): Fewer landscape complaints

## 3. Characteristics of Difficult Regions — Avoid These

Conversely, avoid these areas from the start.

- <strong>Solar-oversaturated regions</strong>: Jeonnam (Hwasun, Wando), parts of Jeonbuk, eastern Gyeongbuk (Uljin, Yeongdeok). Grid saturation + complaint explosion
- <strong>Tourism/resort areas</strong>: Jeju, Gangwon resort zones, Hadong in Gyeongnam
- <strong>Politically sensitive regions</strong>: Areas near elections, active environmental group presence
- <strong>Setback over 500m</strong>: Beyond 500m from roads and residential areas, projects become economically unviable

## 4. Real Cases — Approval Rate Differences in Numbers

Based on 2024 data, the gap between municipalities is enormous.

- <strong>Approval rate 80%+ (easy regions)</strong>:
  - Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi: 92 applications → 85 approved
  - Gochang, Jeonbuk: 67 → 58
  - Goesan, Chungbuk: 45 → 41

- <strong>Approval rate below 30% (difficult regions)</strong>:
  - Uljin, Gyeongbuk: 23 → 5 (1km setback)
  - Gurye, Jeonnam: 18 → 3
  - Parts of Jeju: 50 → 12 (grid saturation)

Western Gyeongnam is a textbook example. Jinju has strict setbacks → low approval. Neighboring Hamyang recently relaxed → approvals surged.

## 5. Five Steps to Find High-Approval Regions

Don't buy random land and face permit rejection.

<strong>Step 1: Check ordinances first</strong>

- Search the Local Legislation Information System → search your target municipality for "solar" + "setback distance"
- Prioritize areas with no ordinances or 100m or less from residential zones

<strong>Step 2: Check permit statistics</strong>

- Municipal government website → search recent "solar permit" notices
- Select areas with high permit counts and few holdups

<strong>Step 3: Verify grid availability</strong>

- Check utility company's distribution equipment availability inquiry
- Prioritize regions with zero backlog

<strong>Step 4: Check local networks</strong>

- Contact local farming cooperatives and solar contractors directly
- Ask: "Have you seen any recent permit approvals here?"

<strong>Step 5: Gauge leadership commitment</strong>

- Call the municipal renewable energy officer
- Ask directly: "Are there plans for solar permits this year?"

## 6. Future Trend — Moving Toward Deregulation

The gap in municipal permits is narrowing. Three reasons:

1. <strong>Government pressure</strong>: Additional REC weight for municipalities that relax setbacks, bonus points for convergence projects
2. <strong>Farmer demand</strong>: Growing need for "sunshine income" amid rural aging
3. <strong>Special legislation</strong>: When the Agrivoltaics Special Act passes, municipal discretion will shrink

By late 2026, over 30 municipalities are expected to have relaxed ordinances. Those who relax now will be the future winners.

Regions with easy permit approval aren't random. They're the result of ordinances, grid capacity, politics, and community receptiveness aligning. Target them from the start. Don't chase cheap land only to get blocked by permits — the losses pile up.
